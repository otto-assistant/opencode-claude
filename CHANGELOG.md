# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Proxy port is dynamic by default (ephemeral bind); live `baseURL` is published via config + auth loader. Optional pin: `OPENCODE_CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT`
- Fix file/PDF attachments: accept OpenAI `file.file_data` and seed `modalities.input` with `pdf` so OpenCode does not strip documents
- Fix image attachments: convert AI SDK `{ type: "image" }` parts (previously detected then dropped); tolerate data-URL name params
- Surface OpenAI-compatible `usage` (tokens + cost_usd + model_usage) from Agent SDK result events; richer compact notes with token counts
- Live Haiku matrix (`bun run test:haiku`): attachments, tools/MCP park-resume, session resume, context/usage, OpenCode CLI `--file`
- Logging: warn/error always on stderr; info gated by `OPENCODE_CLAUDE_DEBUG`; durable mirror at `~/.local/share/opencode-claude/debug.log`; config hook no longer dies on proxy bind errors
- README + package description aligned with opencode-cursor style (header, badges, effort docs)
- Effort variants `low`→`max` exposed as OpenCode model variants (disable generic `none`/`minimal`)
- Multimodal prompts: OpenAI `image_url` / file parts → Claude image & document blocks
- Auto-compact enabled; compact boundary events surfaced in the stream
- Static provider config seeds modalities + variants so attachments and effort survive OpenCode's config path
